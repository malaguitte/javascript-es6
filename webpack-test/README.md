How to install webpack :D

Open a folder, create an empty app.js file.
Then run, `npm init -y` on that folder.

After that runs, you can execute: 
`npm install --save-dev webpack@beta babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015-native-modules`

After that remember to create a `.gitignore` file and include the node_modules directory there.
